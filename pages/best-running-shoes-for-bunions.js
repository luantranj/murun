							<p>If you are dealing with a severe case of bunions, you will be glad to learn that Puma&rsquo;s running shoes have a T-toe construction which can significantly relieve your pain.</p>
							<p>They are made of synthetic leather, with rubber outsole and EVA cushioning in the midsole and heel.</p>
							<p>They will provide you with stability, comfort, support and shock absorption.</p>
							<p>Even if you have bilateral bunions, these sneakers will give you plenty of room in the toe box.</p>
							<p>At the same time, you don&apos;t have to worry about their durability as they are well-made.</p>
							<p>I believe you are having some trouble putting your shoes on, due to your medical condition, but this model will make this much more manageable.</p>
							<p>The shoes are lightweight and affordable.</p>
							<p>However, they run a bit small, so make sure to purchase at least half number larger than your regular size.</p>
							<p>Also, they are not breathable enough, which may cause your feet to smell.</p>
							<p>They are slightly stiff, and the cushioning is not thick enough.</p>

							<p>People with bunions often go for wide fit, but even such design can cause pain.</p>
							<p>However, shoes like Brooks&apos; Ariel 18 have a slightly different toe-box offering precisely what you are looking for &ndash; carefree running.</p>
							<p>This shoe has a synthetic mesh upper and rubber outsole.</p>
							<p>The Super DNA Midsole has excellent cushioning manufactured to offer stability and adequate support to overpronators.</p>
							<p>As I said, you will feel no pain in the bunion area while wearing these shoes.</p>
							<p>Wide toe-box will take care of that for you.</p>
							<p>Even if you are struggling with <Link href="/flat-feet-pronation"><a className="text-decoration-none">flat feet</a></Link> or <Link href="/plantar-fasciitis-trigger-points"><a className="text-decoration-none">plantar fasciitis</a></Link>, these shoes will be gentle and offer all the support you need.</p>
							<p>You will also enjoy their moist-wicking feature and improved segment crash pad that helps you pick up speed.</p>
							<p>However, this model lacks durability, especially when it comes to its mesh upper, which is a significant issue.</p>
							<p>At the same time, the shoes are expensive, so you should think twice before investing in them.</p>

							<p>If you are shopping on a tight budget and you want your bunions to stop bothering you, Avia is the brand you should look into.</p>
							<p>Their Avi-Execute running shoe has a breathable mesh upper with synthetic overlays, lightweight rubber outsole, GELForm removable insole and a molded midsole with grooves for flexibility.</p>
							<p>Avia&rsquo;s model has anatomical cradle design, which makes it perfect for various toe problems like bunions, hammertoes, and deformed nails.</p>
							<p>You can start running as soon as you purchase these sneakers as they don&rsquo;t need any break-in time. They fit as expected and provide superior arch support.</p>
							<p>At last, they are insanely affordable in comparison to other models from this group.</p>
							<p>Unfortunately, their mesh upper gets ripped too easily.</p>
							<p>At the same time, your heel might slip in and out of the shoe which can cause injuries or hurt your heel spurs.</p>
							<p>The sole is too hard and almost feels like plastic, so this is not the most comfortable model on the market.</p>

							<p>If you have several medical conditions combined, looking into therapeutic shoes is a good idea.</p>
							<p>For bunions and running, Dr. Comfort offers their Performance-X shoe.</p>
							<p>They have gel inserts, leather and mesh upper, padded lining and elastic lace closure.</p>
							<p>The double depth design makes them ideal for bunions as they provide extra volume.</p>
							<p>Therapeutic shoes are great as they relieve pressure on your toe joint, and that is exactly what you need.</p>
							<p>Additionally, they come with comfortable inserts, shoe horn, and strong shoelaces which keep your foot stable.</p>
							<p>They are incredibly comfortable, and you can quickly put them on and take them off, without hurting your bunion.</p>
							<p>Unfortunately, Dr. Comfort&rsquo;s Performance-X are a little expensive.</p>
							<p>At the same time, they run half number large and can be slippery on wet surfaces, which means their outsole is not ideal.</p>
							<p>At last, they wear out much quicker than expected.</p>

							<p>Asics, one of the most popular brands among runners, also has bunion friendly shoes.</p>
							<p>Their GEL-Foundation 8 running shoe is made of synthetic upper, rubber sole and EVA, DuoMax dual-density midsole for optimal comfort.</p>
							<p>Full-length gel cushioning and DuraSponge outsole make sure you get optimal support as well.</p>
							<p>If you are looking for a combination of wide toe-box for bunions and fantastic arch support, this is a model to go with.</p>
							<p>GEL-Foundation 8 is breathable and comfortable, due to high-quality materials and their construction.</p>
							<p>Most importantly, they won&apos;t wear down after a few months like some other shoes from this group.</p>
							<p>On the other hand, you&rsquo;ll need some time to get used to them. Don&rsquo;t forget to buy a half number larger shoes, as they run small.</p>
							<p>Also, the tongue is too long which can be inconvenient.</p>
							<p>Even though these are designed specifically for running, I think they are much better as a training shoe for cross fit or fitness.</p>

						<p>Deciding on the best running shoes for bunions is harder than it seems.</p>
						<p>Your feet are on the stake.</p>
						<p>You are deciding whether you&apos;ll feel the pain as you run or not.</p>
						<p>However, I believe I gave you more than enough information on both bunions and available running shoes that could suit your needs on the market.</p>
						<p>If you ask for my advice, I&apos;d say you can&apos;t make a mistake if you go with <Link href="#brooks-ariel-18"><a className="text-decoration-none">Brooks Ariel 18 Running Shoe</a></Link> or <Link href="#asics-gel-foundation-8-running-shoe"><a className="text-decoration-none">ASICS GEL-Foundation 8 Running Shoe</a></Link>.</p>

						<h2 id="what-is-a-bunion" className="fw-bold text-center mb-4" style={{ fontSize: '2.5rem' }}>What is a Bunion?</h2>
						<p>If you have bunions, you know that they are painful and not very pretty.</p>
						<p>They also make finding the right shoes for yourself into a nightmare.</p>
						<p><strong>But what is a bunion exactly?</strong></p>
						<p>It is a bony &ldquo;bump&rdquo; that appears on the joint next to your big toe.</p>
						<p>When your big toe pushes against your second toe, it forces the previously mentioned joint to grow and stick out.</p>
						<p>You can also have <Link href="http://www.aofas.org/footcaremd/treatments/pages/bunionette-deformity-correction.aspx"><a className="text-decoration-none" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">smaller bunions</a></Link> (bunionettes) which appear the same way as the big ones, but they are placed on the joint of your little toe.</p>
						<p>Once a bunion (or a bunionette) forms, the skin in that area can turn red and become sore.</p>
						<p>Most commonly, bunions are a result of a medical condition (for example, arthritis), an inherited structural defect or increased stress on your foot.</p>
						<p>It is crucial that you wear comfortable and wide enough shoes because tight and narrow footwear might make your bunions worse or cause them in the first place.</p>

						<h2 id="what-to-look-for-in-running-shoes-for-bunions" className="fw-bold text-center mb-4" style={{ fontSize: '2.5rem' }}>What to Look for in Running Shoes for Bunions?</h2>
						<p>Now that you know what bunions are, what causes them and what are the risk factors for developing them, you can take the necessary steps to stop that from happening.</p>
						<p><strong>The first step is choosing right running shoes for yourself.</strong></p>
						<p>Even if you have bunions already, adequate running shoes can prevent further complications and alleviate the pain you are feeling.</p>
						<p>Here&rsquo;s what you should look for:</p>
		
						<h3 className="mt-5">Wide Toe-Box and Proper Support</h3>
						<p>High-quality running shoes for bunions must provide all the support you need.</p>
						<p>You have to know whether you are an overpronator, underpronator, or neutral, or if you have any other foot problem such as <Link href="/how-to-wrap-foot-for-plantar-fasciitis-with-ace-bandage/"><a className="text-decoration-none">plantar fasciitis</a></Link> or <Link href="/achilles-tendon-massage"><a className="text-decoration-none">Achilles tendonitis</a></Link>.</p>
						<p>So, the first thing you should look for is adequate support for your type of feet.</p>
						<p>Once you find a range of shoes that suit your needs, look for a wide toe box and cushioning in the forefoot.</p>
						<p>Search for shoes that have wide toe-box rather than regular shoes with a wide fit, because if you have narrow feet, these might be too loose for you in the midfoot and heel area.</p>

						<h3 className="mt-5">Upper Mesh and Flexibility</h3>
						<p>Flexible, soft mesh upper means less pressure on your bunion.</p>
						<p>So, make sure that the toe box is covered with mesh instead then leather or any other material.</p>
						<p>The truth is, mesh will offer you more flexibility, but at the same time, it will provide less support.</p>
						<p>If your feet are neutral, this won&apos;t be a problem, but if you are an over-pronator, for example, you&rsquo;ll have to find a sweet spot between flexibility and stability that you need.</p>
						<p>Good running shoes for bunions are wide in the forefoot, provide excellent arch support to avoid excessive pronation that can be caused by putting stress on the big toe joint.</p>
						<p>At last, they are flexible enough to allow for a relaxed push off.</p>

						<h3 className="mt-5">Shoelaces</h3>
						<p>Make sure that the shoes you are going to purchase, have shoelaces and that you can customize them as you need.</p>
						<p>You&rsquo;ll have to lace your shoe, so it provides maximum support through the midfoot and minimizes the pressure on your bunion.</p>
